# Create scatter plot graphs

> **Note:** This is a beta feature. Time series panel is going to replace the Graph panel in the future releases.

This section explains how to use Time series field options to create a scatter plot graph and illustrates what the options do.

## Create a scatter plot graph

1. [Add a panel](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels/add-a-panel/). Select the [Time series]({{< relref "_index.md" >}}) visualization.
1. In the [Panel editor](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/panels/panel-editor/), click the **Field** tab.
1. In Style, click **Points**.

## Style the scatter plot graph

Use the following field settings to refine your scatter plot graph.

For more information about applying these options, refer to:

- [Configure all fields]({{< relref "../../field-options/configure-all-fields.md" >}})
- [Configure specific fields]({{< relref "../../field-options/configure-specific-fields.md" >}})

Some field options will not affect the visualization until you click outside of the field option box you are editing or press Enter.

## Style your scatter plot graph

Use the following setting to refine your bar graph.

### Point size

Set the size of the points, from 1 to 40 pixels in diameter.
